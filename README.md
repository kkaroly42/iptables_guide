# iptables_guide

This is a crossplatform Python application for generating IPTables rules with a GUI.

Our goal is to create a safe, practical, well-designed application that can be used for learning pourpouses and real use as well.

### Technologies we use:
- [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Qt for Python](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python)
- [Scapy](https://scapy.net/)
